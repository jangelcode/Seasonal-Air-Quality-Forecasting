## Project Description

The study focuses on identifying long-term air quality trends and seasonal variations in Maricopa County from 1994 to 2024. It employs seasonal decomposition to uncover periodic patterns and utilizes a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast future AQI values. The primary objective is to provide data-driven insights for public health officials, environmental planners, and policymakers.
